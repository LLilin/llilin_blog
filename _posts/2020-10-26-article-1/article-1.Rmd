## III - ANALYSIS TABLE ABOUT THE STUDY

| Researchers | University of Arizona, Dr. Erin Riordan |
|---|---|
| Published in  | 29 July 2020  |
| General topic  |  Crop sustainability in arid environments (American desert) |
| Procedure / What was examined  |  Sustainability of different crops, conventional ones (like wheat, rice and soy) compared to indigenous ones (agaves, cacti, succulents and legumes) in an arid environment with a poor soil subjected to frequent droughts and floods, based on the requirements in terms of water, chemicals and energy.Benefits of the use of indigenous crops (ecosystems, health, working conditions). |
| Conclusion / discovery  | Indigenous crops are the more thriving in arid climates.The researchers also give guidelines to plant the crops and implement them in the local economy  |
| Remaining questions  | The indigenous crops will have some difficulty challenging the industry preferences for more conventional crops. The research team believes their results could be applied to other similar regions.  |
